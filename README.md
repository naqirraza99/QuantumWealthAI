# 🌌 QuantumWealth AI - Hyper-Personalized Investment Optimization

A **Quantum-AI Hybrid Portfolio Optimization System** that blends **quantum-inspired optimization** with **AI-powered sentiment analysis** to deliver faster, smarter, and hyper-personalized investment strategies.

## 🧠 Overview

Traditional investment strategies often fail under dynamic market conditions. QuantumWealth AI solves this through:

- 🧮 **QUBO-Based Asset Optimization**
- ⚛ **Quantum Superposition-Inspired Scenario Modeling**
- 🤖 **Transformer-Based Sentiment Analysis (Hugging Face)**
- 📈 **Dynamic Fund Allocation Based on Risk–Return Ratios**

## 🚀 Key Features

- **QUBO-Based Asset Selection**  
  Optimizes portfolio using Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) solved via simulated annealing.

- **Superposition-Driven Scenario Modeling**  
  Simulates multiple market states in parallel for robust risk management.

- **Hybrid Sentiment Engine**  
  Combines pre-labeled sentiment data and Hugging Face NLP to adjust expected returns in real-time.

- **Dynamic Fund Allocation**  
  Allocates funds based on dynamic risk–return scoring instead of static models.

- **Interactive Dashboard**  
  Built with **Streamlit**, visualizing portfolio performance, market sentiment, and optimal allocations.
